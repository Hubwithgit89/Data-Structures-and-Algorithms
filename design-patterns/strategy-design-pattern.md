# Strategy Design Pattern

## When to use it?

* When you want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behavior in the list.&#x20;
* When you need to use one of the several behaviors dynamically

## Pros ( :thumbsup:) & Cons ( :thumbsdown:):



* :thumbsup: Often reduces the long list of conditionals
* :thumbsup: Reduce duplicate code
* :thumbsup: Keeps class changes from forcing other class changes
* :thumbsup: can hide complicated/secret code from the user



* :thumbsdown: Increased number of objects and classes
